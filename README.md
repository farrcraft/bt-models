# bt-models

This is a golang library that defines the structures representing the corresponding 
SQL schema structure.  They also provide the mapping to a JSON-serialized format.
The common library can be shared between the web-api for interacting with the SQL-
based store and the electron-backend for local storage & web-api interoperability.
